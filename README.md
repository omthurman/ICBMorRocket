# Welcome to Spaceship or Missile!
Welcome to Spaceship or Missile, a full stack application that combines a React front-end and a Flask back-end to host a TensorFlow-based neural network image classifier. Users can upload images, enabling the image classifier model to make predictions by distinguishing between Falcon 9 rockets and an assortment of missiles.

Though the model's performance is currently not optimal due to limited training data (approximately 100 images), I am confident that with a more extensive dataset, this application has the potential to scale impressively and deliver more accurate results.


# Purpose
This app is a true reflection of my passion for technology and my eagerness to learn and adapt to new technologies at any level of the stack.  I am someone who loves mastering new technologies and learning new things, I designed this app to showcase my versatility and willingness to learn in a fast paced environment. While my experience as a data analyst working with Python, SQL, and Tableau in a high-stakes sophisticated private equity firm has given me strong skills in business and financial analysis, I also have a deep appreciation for the bigger picture of an organization. I am committed to understanding other departments on a technical and interpersonal level, which allows me to be an effective communicator and problem-solver within any team.

Through this project, I was able to demonstrate my ability to master new technologies such as React, Flask, and TensorFlow, as well as incorporate additional features such as a web scraper and a planned SQL database to improve the app's functionality.

While it's true that regulatory bodies already employ other sophisticated detection methods, Spaceship or Missile stands as a testament to the creative applications of neural networks in real-world scenarios and adds an additional layer of support to existing safety protocols. Plus it just sounded like fun to build!


# Note
As a SpaceX recruiter, I believe you'll appreciate the potential of Spaceship or Missile as a showcase of technical expertise, creativity, and commitment to solving real-world challenges. With its exciting features and the vision for future enhancements, this project demonstrates a genuine passion for the field and the drive to make a difference in the world of space exploration and security.
