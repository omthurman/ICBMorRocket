# Welcome to Spaceship or Missile!
Welcome to Spaceship or Missile, a full stack application that combines a React front-end and a Flask back-end to host a TensorFlow-based neural network image classifier. Users can upload images, enabling the image classifier model to make predictions by distinguishing between Falcon 9 rockets and an assortment of missiles.

Though the model's performance is currently not optimal due to limited training data (approximately 100 images), I am confident that with a more extensive dataset, this application has the potential to scale impressively and deliver more accurate results.

# Purpose
This  app was designed to showcase my ability to adapt to and master new technologies across the entire stack, while also delivering an engaging and enjoyable user experience. By developing a neural network that can differentiate between spacecraft and missiles, this technology has the potential to serve as a safety measure to prevent misunderstandings and ensure security.

While it's true that regulatory bodies already employ other sophisticated detection methods, Spaceship or Missile stands as a testament to the creative applications of neural networks in real-world scenarios and adds an additional layer of support to existing safety protocols. Plua it just sounded like fun to build!


# Side features
Spaceship or Missile also incorporates a handy web scraper to source images from the internet. In future updates, we plan to integrate this web scraper directly into the front-end, allowing users to seamlessly select any two items to be used for training the model. Furthermore, we aim to enhance the project by incorporating a SQL database for storing vectorized images, providing a more robust and organized system for managing the data.


# Note
As a SpaceX recruiter, I believe you'll appreciate the potential of Spaceship or Missile as a showcase of technical expertise, creativity, and commitment to solving real-world challenges. With its exciting features and the vision for future enhancements, this project demonstrates a genuine passion for the field and the drive to make a difference in the world of space exploration and security.
