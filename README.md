# Welcome to the Spaceship or Missile!


Spaceship or Missile is a full-stack application that demonstrates my proficiency in web development and machine learning. The app uses React, Flask, and TensorFlow to provide users with an image classification system. The neural network has been trained on a limited dataset of around 100 images, so its performance may not be perfect, but it can recognize the Falcon 9 rocket and an assortment of missiles.


In addition to the image classifier, the app features a web scraper that can assist in collecting images from the internet. I plan to integrate this scraper into the front-end to make it easier to retrieve images for training the model. I also aim to include a SQL database to store vectorized images for easy access and management of training data.


Overall, Spaceship or Missile is a practical demonstration of my ability to learn new technologies at any level of the stack and apply them to create useful applications.
