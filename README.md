# Image Classifier App: React-Flask Neural Network
Welcome to the Spaceship or Missile! A full stack application that utilizes a React front-end and a Flask back-end to host a neural network image classifier built with tensorflow. This application allows users to upload images and receive predictions from the image classifier model, which has been trained to recognize the Falcon 9 rocket as well as an array of Missiles. The performance on the model is not great, and it frequently gets things wrong. That is because it has only been trained on around 100 images total, I believe with more training data this app would scale very well.


# Purpose
This small app was created to showcase my skills and range of expertise, plus it sounded fun to create. My thinking is that such a nueral network, scaled up properly, could be used as a safety measure to avoid misunderstandings. I will admit that it is likely any such regulatory body would likely use other measures of detection such as radar, but I stil thought it would be a fun little project.


# Side features
The application also includes a short webscraper to help get images from the internet, in the future I plan to integrate this web-scraper into the model, so that any two items can automatically be pulled from the internet and used to train the model.
